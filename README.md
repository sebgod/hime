The Hime parser generator is a parser generator for the various platforms. It primarily supports the LR family of parsing methods, including GLR (Generalized-LR). Key distinguishing features are:

* Fast LR and GLR parsing.
* Modern implementation of GLR with the [RNGLR algorithm](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146809.1146810&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=9339017&CFTOKEN=49072692).
* [Simple and clear API](http://himedoc.bitbucket.org/v1.1.0/namespaceHime_1_1Redist.html) to manipulate parse trees.
* [Extensive SDK API](http://himedoc.bitbucket.org/v1.1.0/namespaceHime_1_1CentralDogma.html) to programmatically manipulate grammars, generate lexers and parsers and use them.
* Strong emphasis on separating data and code. Hime forbids the inclusion of inline code in its grammar definitions in order to have very readable grammars that can be easily understood, debugged, improved. It is still possible to have custom code invoked during parsing with semantic actions.

The parser generator requires the .Net runtime (or Mono) for the generation of parsers, but these can be generated for other platforms, the supported one are:

* .Net framework 2.0+, or Mono on Linux and MacOS
* Java 7+



### How do I use this software? ###

All user documentation is available in the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/laurentw/hime/wiki/Home).

### How to build ###

All .Net software components are written in C# and integrated in a single Visual Studio solution file: `HimeSystems.sln` at the repository's root. All software components can be built from the component as follow:

#### Build the runtimes ####

Build the .Net runtime (on the .Net Framework with MSBuild):

```
$ msbuild /p:Configuration=Release runtimes/net/Hime.Redist.csproj
```

Build the .Net runtime (on Mono with xbuild):

```
$ xbuild /p:Configuration=Release runtimes/net/Hime.Redist.csproj
```

Build the Java runtime with Maven:

```
$ mvn -f runtimes/java/pom.xml clean package
```

#### Build the parser generator ####

Building the .Net command line interface for the parser generator will automatically build its required dependencies.

On the .Net Framework with MSBuild:

```
$ msbuild /p:Configuration=Release cli/net/HimeCC.csproj
```

On Mono with xbuild:

```
$ xbuild /p:Configuration=Release cli/net/HimeCC.csproj
```

The results are put in `cli/net/bin/Release`.



### Run the tests ###

#### Run the runtimes tests ####

A common set of tests are executed on all runtime implementation.
The results are output in the JUnit format at `tests/multi/TestResults.xml`.
Running the tests requires a local installation of Mono, xbuild and Maven.

```
$ sh tests/multi/execute.sh
```

On Windows, the script can be run with Cygwin.

#### For newcomers ####

The [isse tracker](https://bitbucket.org/laurentw/hime/issues) contains tickets that are accessible to newcomers. Look for tickets with `[beginner]` in the title. These tickets are good ways to become more familiar with the project and the codebase.

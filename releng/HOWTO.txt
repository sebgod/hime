How to build and release Hime components

1) Update the version numbers for the components
	1) For .Net artifacts, update the releng/VersionInfo.cs file, all .Net artifacts include this file
	2) For Java artifacts, update the pom.xml: runtimes/java/pom.xml

2) Build NuGet packages
	1) Execute releng/nuget/package.sh
	2) NuGet packages are put into releng/nuget

3) Publish NuGet packages
	1) Set Nuget API key: $ nuget SetApi Key <key>
	2) Execute nuget push <package file> on each normal package in releng/nuget
	3) The <name>.symbols.nupkg are automatically pushed to SymbolSource.org when the <name>.nupkg is pushed to NuGet.org
	4) Deleted the nupkg from releng/nuget

4) Build and publish Java components
	1) Setup a GPG key with developer's name and email
	2) $ cd runtimes/java
	3) $ mvn clean deploy

5) Package and deploy the standalone release
	1) Use an IDE (VS, MonoDevelop, ...) or the CLI, to build all components with the RELEASE profile in the HimeSystems.sln solution
	2) Build java components:
		1) $ cd runtimes/java
		2) $ mvn clean package
	3) Execute releng/standalone/package.sh vX.Y.Z
	4) The result is the zip hime-vX.Y.Z.zip at the root
	5) Upload the zip to Bitbucket

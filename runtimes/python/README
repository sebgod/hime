hime.redist
===========

hime.redist is the redistributable runtime for the parsers generated
with the `Hime`_ parser generator while targeting the Python platform.

This runtime, as well as all `Hime`_ components, is licensed under the `LGPL v3+`_.


Install
=======

To install this package using pip::

    $ pip install hime.redist


Parser Generation
=================

This package only contains the Python runtime for the generated parsers;
it is not able to generate the parsers themselves.
To generate new parsers, the `Hime SDK`_ must be downloaded and used.
The `Hime SDK`_ requires a local installation of .Net 2+, or `Mono`_.
To generate parsers targeting the Python runtime, use::

    $ himecc MyGrammar.gram -t:python

or with `Mono`_::

    $ mono himecc.exe MyGrammar.gram -t:python

Refer to the `Hime documentation`_ for more details.
